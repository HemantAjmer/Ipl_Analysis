# 🏏 **IPL Data Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project** 🖥️📊

Welcome to the **IPL EDA Project**! This repository explores IPL cricket datasets to uncover fascinating insights about teams, players, and game trends. 🏆✨

---

## 🌟 **Overview**
This project delves into IPL datasets to:
- ✅ Understand and clean data.
- ✅ Visualize trends and patterns.
- ✅ Answer key analytical questions about team performance, batting, and bowling strategies.

**Tech Stack**:  
🐍 Python | 📊 Matplotlib | 🐼 Pandas | 🎨 Seaborn | 🔢 NumPy

## 📂 **Datasets**
- **Matches Dataset**: Summary of IPL matches (teams, results, etc.).
- **Deliveries Dataset**: Ball-by-ball details (runs, extras, dismissals, etc.).

---

## 🔍 **Key Questions Answered**
📌 How are runs distributed across overs?  
📌 Do teams rely more on boundaries for scoring?  
📌 Which bowlers have the best economy and strike rates?  
📌 Are there trends in dismissal types?  
📌 How have scoring patterns evolved across IPL seasons?
